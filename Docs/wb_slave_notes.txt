========== wb_slave module ==========
NOTEs::
	1. configurable memory {mem_width, mem_depth}.
	2. set we: write operation.
	3. reset we: read operation.
	4. for 1st channel: addresses {
		ctrl => 0x00
		period => 0x01
		divisor => 0x02
		DC => 0x03
	}
		|
		|
	for 4th channel: addresses {
		ctrl => 0x12
		period => 0x13
		divisor => 0x14
		DC => 0x15
	}
	5. set wb_ack if a read or write operation's done.
Verification Scenarios::
	1. Functional Correctness (RESET behavior)
	2. Functional Correctness (Write random data to all registers)
	3. Functional Correctness (Read from all registers)
	4. Corner Case (i_wb_adr >= mem_depth)
