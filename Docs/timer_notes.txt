============================== pwm module ==============================
NOTEs::
    1. If main counter reaches or exceedes the period_reg
    2. In continous mode, an interrupt pulse is generated always if counter equals the period_reg
    3. In one-shot mode, a single interrupt pulse is generated if counter equals the period_reg
    4. If the pulse is generated, an irq_flag is set to high. This flag to be wriiten in ctrl[5]
Verification Scenarios::
    1. Functional Correctness (RESET behavior)
    2. Functional Correctness (cont. mode, period = 4)
    3. Functional Correctness (one-shot mode, period = 4)
    4. Corner Case (cont. mode, period = 1)
    5. Corner Case (one-shot mode, period = 1)
